Description: Functions like optim(par,f) require "par" to be a vector and "f"
    to be a function of a vector. Often you'll want to optimise a cost function
    with several arguments, for example a scalar, a vector and a matrix, and it's
    more natural to define f = function(scalar,vector,matrix) instead of packing
    everything into a single vector. vecpack does the packing and unpacking for you.
